# client-blog
/*
For this project, I interviewed Sumaya about her font, color, and subject preferences for her client blog. She chose the topic of global hunger. I strived to create a web page that reflected her preferred tone of serious and considerate. 

I first outlined the HTML for the project based on my wireframes sketch with the headers, article, and footer. I filled in the Nav portion with divs.  I spent some time using inspect element on sites that covered similar topics to get ideas for order. 

I chose a background image with subtle neutral tone design on white so as not to distract from the images, which I think are the highlight of the page. I also wanted to make a point to use pictures of children on pixabay who faced hunger crises, but that didn't exploit them as objects of tragedy. The children in the images look calm, self-possessed, and curious in spite of their situation. Since I wanted the blog to be image-focused, I used the CSS styling element of background-image to create the blog post header. I placed the blog post title atop the blog post header. I used the float images to wrap text around them and create balance on the page. If I get ahead, I'd like to spend more time finishing the bottom decorative blogpost navigation I created to go to previous and next entries as well as the footer.
